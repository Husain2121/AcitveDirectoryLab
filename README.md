<h1>Active Directory Enterprise Home Lab</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
The project consists of a fully functional Active Directory home lab constructed with Oracle VirtualBox on a personal computer. The lab demonstrates how to set up a Windows Server 2019 domain controller with DNS, DHCP, NAT routing, and Active Directory Domain Services. The environment consists of a Windows 10 client computer that joins the domain and authenticates using domain credentials, as well as automated user provisioning through a PowerShell script that creates domain users in bulk. In a realistic enterprise-style lab environment, this project illustrates fundamental PowerShell automation, virtualization, directory services, and Windows networking concepts.
